# Secret Santa game assigner using QR-Codes (server version)

Simple web application that presents a form where a user can enter a list of
participants, and then, renders a web page with the gift givers and QR-Code
encoded gift receivers.

## Installation

You can build using [Cabal](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/), but in order for it
to work, the `static` directory must be accessible from the executable path.

## Usage

    $ ./secret-santa-server [port]
